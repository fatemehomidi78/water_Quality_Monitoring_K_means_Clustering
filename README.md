Abstract:

In this project, we utilized K-means clustering to generate a spatial zoning map of groundwater quality in Tehran for a one-month period in the Iranian calendar year 1394. 
Groundwater quality is a critical aspect of environmental monitoring, with implications for public health and ecosystem integrity. By applying clustering techniques to groundwater quality data, we aimed to identify spatial patterns and zones of similar water quality characteristics within the study area.
We collected groundwater quality data from various monitoring wells across Tehran for the selected time period using https://stu.wrm.ir/login.asp . The dataset included parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, concentrations of various ions, and other relevant indicators of water quality. Using Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook environment, we implemented K-means clustering to group monitoring wells into clusters based on the similarity of their groundwater quality attributes.
A key decision in the clustering process was determining the optimal number of clusters (K). After conducting exploratory data analysis and evaluating clustering results for different values of K, we determined that K=9 provided meaningful and interpretable zoning of groundwater quality in Tehran. Each cluster represented a distinct zone with similar groundwater quality characteristics.
The resulting spatial zoning map revealed spatial patterns and hotspots of groundwater quality within Tehran. Areas with similar water quality profiles were grouped together, highlighting potential sources of contamination or natural variations in groundwater composition. Additionally, the map facilitated the identification of areas with distinct water quality challenges, which can inform targeted remediation and management strategies.
Our project demonstrates the application of K-means clustering and spatial analysis techniques to groundwater quality monitoring, offering a valuable tool for environmental assessment and management in urban areas like Tehran. The spatial zoning map provides stakeholders with actionable insights into the distribution of groundwater quality, supporting evidence-based decision-making for sustainable water resource management.
