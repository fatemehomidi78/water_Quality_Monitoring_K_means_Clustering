Abstract:

Our project demonstrates the application of K-means clustering to groundwater quality monitoring, offering a valuable tool for environmental assessment and management in urban areas. The zoning map provides stakeholders (e.g. farmers and households) with actionable insights into the distribution of groundwater quality, supporting evidence-based decision-making for better water resource management.
